brief `A security alert has been triggered on one of your enterprise's Linux machines, indicating a possible full compromise. Following the established Incident Response (IR) procedures, a team member has promptly isolated the affected machine and initiated log recovery. Your specific responsibility now involves conducting a thorough investigation into this security incident.

#### Prerequisites

As a a member of the Incident Response Team, you initiated a meeting with the team responsible for the machine, where you gathered information that there has been an incident related to the accidental leakage of multiple files (documents and configuration files) by one of the developers. The process of investigating which files were leaked is still ongoing. Furthermore, the team has also confirmed that the only service exposed to the internet is the one associated with the SSH service. Additionally, the machine is hardened to disallow SSH authentication using passwords. You have access to Elasticsearch on port 5601 HTTP with credentials admin:admin`
